The respective experts or tutors provide skills listed on INFODAL. INFODAL disclaims any liability for the content of the listings and profiles supplied by its Service.

PROFESSIONAL TUTORING GUIDELINES
Putting your knowledge out there on INFODAL means that you're willing to assume full responsibility for the quality of the Service provided.
Anyone may view your posted skill and contact you about learning it, so when you put it up on INFODAL, you could expect much interest from people looking to improve their knowledge in that area.
You agree that if a student contacts you through INFODAL.com, you will respond within the time frame and for the fee specified in your skill post. You will not refuse correspondence from any student for illegal or discriminatory reasons.
You agree that we may, at our discretion, display adverts on your INFODAL skill.
If you do not have the owner's permission to use their intellectual property in your submission to the Service, you agree that your request will not include such content.
You guarantee to INFODAL that you have the necessary qualifications to instruct the abilities you've listed and that you'll always act professionally & conform to all relevant laws.
You concur that you will not misuse your pupils' private information. Using students' personal information beyond what was stated in your skill post without their permission constitutes abuse.
You're aware that if you give a lesson to a prospective student, the student will have the option to leave feedback about their time spent learning from you. We have no way of knowing what a user will say in a review and therefore cannot be liable for the content of any review.
INFODAL may remove the published talent at any time and for any cause.
